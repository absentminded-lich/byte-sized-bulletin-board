# byte-sized-bulletin-board

**About**

Byte-Sized Bulletin Board is a modern solution to the once popular, now impractical, weathered wooden boards that could be found alongside every bandit infested trade route.

**Fun Notes**

I envisioned the product as a Tinder-like service for adventurers who want to match with NPCs that are offering one or more quests (as opposed to matching directly with the quest). I later realized that there are actually two services here; one for adventurers looking for quests and one for NPCs looking for adventurers. This website is selling the former.
